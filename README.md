Software Engineering Large Practical - Audience Response System
======================================
This project was developed for a course at university, the Software Engineering Large Practical 2014 (http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/selp/).

This project is an "Audience Response System" - This system would be useful in a lecture or classroom setting where the tutor can set questions for students and instantly send them to the students' devices for them to answer, the results are then displayed instantly on the Tutor's computer.

The entire application is web based so does not require any special hardware or software to be installed on the tutor or students' devices, it just requires a single webserver to run which could serve an entire institution.

The included report (report.pdf and report.tex) provides a lot of information about the project as well as instructions on how to set it up.
